Version: *1.0*
<br />
Author: *Ash Wilson* - *@ashmastaflash*

This is a simple policy for detecting the presence of two Bitcoin mining programs, CPUMiner and CUDAMiner.  The CPUMiner check demonstrates a process existence check and the CUDAMiner check looks for the existence of a binary in the filesystem.
